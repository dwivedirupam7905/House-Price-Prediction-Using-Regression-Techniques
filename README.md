# House-Price-Prediction-Using-Regression-Techniques

- This project is based on preparing a machine learning model to predict the price for any new house by just looking at the features of the house.
- Number of rooms, property tax rate, population status, age of houses, regional crime rate, accessibility to radial highways or employment centers, regional pollution level etc. are some of the major features.
- Boston housing data from UCI machine learning repository is used for the study and analysis.
- Machine learning algorithms such as **linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression** etc. are used to choose the optimal model for the accurate predictions.

### Tools and Requirements:
Jupyter notebook, Python 3.7, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib, Boston housing data, UCI ML Repository, Anaconda Software and other machine learning libraries.
